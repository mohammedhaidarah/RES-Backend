cloud formation cloud front s and route expertise in building rich interactive user interfaces using html css javascrip t jquery node js and angular j s gathered and clarified requirements with business analyst to feed into high level customization design development and installation phases used spring framework for dependency injection for action classes using application context xml file involved in implementatio n of mvc pattern using jsp and spring controller developed business objects using spring ioc spring mvc and spring aop implemented mvc architecture using jsp spring hibernate and used spring framework to initialize managed beans and services implement ed soa architecture with web services using soap jax ws wsdl uddi and xml used collections for model classes in the dao layer data a ess object involved in modifying some changes in dao layer using hibernate created mappings among the relations and written sql queries using hibernate implemented concurrency exception handling and collections whenever necessary used entity beans to persist the data into ibm db database like database a ess components creating schemas and tables used sql to perform data mapping and backend testing also documented all the sql queries for future testing purpose created process flow for deploying application in web sphere application server managed build reporting and documentation from the project informati on using jenkins maven tool and svn for version control used jenkins for continuous integration used junit for testing and used jira for tracking bugs responsible for the

modules of social insurance developed the application using spring framework that leverages classical model view layer mvc architecture uml diagrams like use cases class diagrams interaction diagrams sequence an d collaboration and activity diagrams were used developed jee modules using xmi and core java interaction with business users for user and system a eptance testing validated the data against the business rules data a ess layer is implemented using hibernate used apache poi to generate excel documents implemented struts action classes used spring security for authentication and authorization extensively utilized eclipse to create jsps servlets hibernate that pulled information from a oracle databa se and sent to a front end gui for end users used jdbc for oracle database connection and written number of stored procedures for retrieving the data developed modules for validating the data a ording to business rules and used castor to convert data in to array of xml strings and xslt for transformation used hibernate for data persistence developed soap based http requests for communicating with web services was involved in the design of multi tier architecture using ejb servlets and jsp u sed spring dependency injection properties to provide loose coupling between layers collaborated with web designers to create the jsp pages applying html javascript jquery

responsibilities designed and developed servlets and jsp which presents the end user with form to submit the details of the problem created sql statements and triggers for the effective retrieval and storage of data from the database performed junit testing proposed and implemented performance enhancements worked with oracle databases running sql scripts and stored procedures developed restful based web services was involved in the design of multi tier architecture using ejb servlets and jsp developed servlets used to store user information in the database wh ich makes a jdbc odbc connection to the database and inserts the details into to the database designed and developed a servlet which presents the engineer a form to submit solution to particular problem setting up test environments and configuring vario us components of the application using jdbc api to establish a connection with oracle database and configuring designed and developed a servlet which allows the end user to query on the problem makes a jdbc odbc connection to the database and retrieve t he details regarding the call number and the status of the submitted problem environment java jee servlets jsp
